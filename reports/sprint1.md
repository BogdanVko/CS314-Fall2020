## Planned Epics
# Team Identification

We will properly edit the website so that our team name and number are displayed on the client. Additionally, we will modify the server code to return the team identification when communicating with the client. 

# About

We will add an "About" section to the webpage where users can find more information about our team. Users will see our team image along with our team mission statement. Each team member will have a section for their image, their name, and their bio. 

# Trip

Here, we will add interaction to the site by allowing users to click on the map and have the destination saved to a running list. We will include a button to clear the list and allow users to remove individual list items. 

# Place Details

We will add details for each location the user clicks on the map. Using reverse geocoding, we will fetch more information about the location. The details will be displayed in the map when a user clicks a location, and saved with the location in the trip list.  

# Maps

We will add different options for map interfaces for the user. The user will be able to choose which map they prefer, and their preference will be saved for their next visit to the website.

## Retrospective

#### Things that went well

As a team, we communicated with eachother effectively and reached out to eachother for giving and receiving help. We organized our team preferences and meeting times to accomodate eachother's schedules, and followed through on every planned meeting. Throughout the sprint, we fostered a good atmosphere for communication in our team's Slack channel. When a team member was stuck while trying to complete a task or configure their development environment, other team members responded promptly and assisted them. When several team members were unclear on how the different React components interacted with eachother, we held a team meeting on Teams, shared screens, and helped eachother understand. Team meetings were never missed, but when a member had a scheduling confict we were able to accomodate and reschedule. 

#### Things that we need to improve

Our planning is one area in which we did not do a thourough job of delegating tasks effectively. We assigned all tasks for the sprint during the first scrum meeting. This left us having to re-assign tasks throughout the sprint, and made the ZenHub page less useful. Every task was either in progress or closed, even if some tasks had not actually been started. Additionally, we assigned tasks to each team member based roughly off of the epics. This assignment method was not productive as those assigned to the later epics could not start on their tasks until other team members were done. 

As a whole, we did not complete tasks as early as we would have liked to, leaving much of the work for the last few days of the sprint. This led to us not being able to complete the last two epics, as coordinating work became more challenging with less time. Additionally, our meetings were not as productive as they could have been if team members worked to understand as much of the material as they could before attending meetings.

#### One thing we will change next time

In the future, our planning and organization will be much better. We will set expectations for each team meeting for what tasks need to be completed, and will assign tasks only in our daily scrums. We will also assign tasks more evenly such that each team member receives roughly equal portions of each epic. Additionally, we will assign tasks in each meeting according to the tasks priority, so that we minimize team members having to wait on others to begin their tasks.
