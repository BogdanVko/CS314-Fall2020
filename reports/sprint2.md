## Retrospective

### Things that went well
We were able to communicate better this time around and actually met up with each 
often. Many times several teammates worked together on the same code. Our communication
### Things we need to improve
We didn't have a great idea of what were the expectations for this Spring, so the first week was confusing.
Definitely next time we should all work together on planning and understanding the first days of the Sprint.
This time we got to the part of being productive later in the Sprint, closer to the 2nd week.
### One thing we will change next time
Start working hard sooner.
