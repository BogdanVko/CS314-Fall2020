# User Experience - Team *T24* 

The report summarizes a round of user experience testing performed on the team's application.

Each developer should ask the user to accomplish one or more simple tasks while monitoring their efforts.  
The user should attempt to complete the tasks without any aid from the developer.
Use a pseudonym to identify the user below. 
Age, nationality, and other background information can sometimes be helpful understanding the problems a user encountered.

One task is provided along with a 10 minute time limit.
Your team should identify additional tasks to explore your application more fully and alter the time limit if necessary.

Developers should not guide the user, but the user may ask for help as a last resort.  
Consider this a failure when it happens.  
Record the failures, problems they encountered, and any aid that is given along with anything you notice from their use of the application.
 
### Tasks

Each user should complete the following tasks in 10 minutes:

* Search up a place and add it to the list
* Create a trip to several cities around the world you would like to visit.
* Locate and delete a place of their choosing
