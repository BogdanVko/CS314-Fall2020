# Preferences for Benjamin Siler

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * Text and email are good any day of the week from 9-6 MST. My phone number is 901-628-0406 and email is bsiler@rams.colostate.edu.
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * Our team will learn how to work well with each other and communicate effectively to overcome challenges.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I aim to communicate more clearly with teammates and be more firm than I have been previously. I also aim to help my teammates when needed.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * Obstacles might include a teammate who is a 'hitchhiker' or 'couch potato', and myself not communicating well. 
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * As far as I understand, the grading system for this class would not allow for everyone to be happy in this situation as it would require the student who wants an A to do more work than their teammates. So instead our team should strive for an A on everything. 
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * If that person is happy to do the extra work and the other teammates do not care, then I see nothing wrong with it. However, it seems unrealistic that those conditions would be met. 
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * ~10 hours per week (more or less depending on the stage of production). 
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * Try to balance personal preferences with an overall even distribution of work
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * We should communicate to them that it is not fair to the team to do so, and if done again without warning speak to TAs/Dave
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * Quality of work should be fairly objective, and otherwise attempt to resolve the disagreement. If we can't resolve the disagreement and it is causing trouble then appeal to TAs/Dave
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * Setting clear deadlines and enforcing them, and communicating when someone's work habits are causing problems
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * Not necessarily, but I would be open to it
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * I do not know, roughly 2-3 times per week (maybe?)
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * It is dependent on the decision. But in some capacity the work should be approved by the rest of the team when it is finished
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Attempt to understand their perspective but ultimately go with the majority if not everyone can agree and the decision must be made
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * Ask them to leave other work for others as it directly affects our grades
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would communicate that to my teammates and ask them to pick up some slack
