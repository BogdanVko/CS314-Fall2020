# Preferences for Tor Larson

1. __Is it generally easier to reach you by text, electronic mail, voice mail or something else?  What hours?__ 
   * I will be checking my slack daily and can be reached here 10am-9pm, but if you ever need to reach me immediately, a text or call is best. (3038955960)
1. __What are your expectations about what your team will accomplish this semester?__ 
   * I would like to create something that we all are actually proud of, and if we do this i Believe a good grade will follow.
1. __What are your personal goals for improving your teamwork and communication skills this semester?__ 
   * I would like to make sure I pull my own weight, get things done in a timely manner, and that I frequently check our group chat to keep up to date on what is happening.
1. __What kinds of obstacles might you encounter in trying to reach both your team and personal goals?__ 
   * I have a very tough course load this semester, so it will be tough to balance everything, but I want to make sure to put my team ahead of my other classes so i dont let them down.
1. __What happens if some people on the team want to get an “A” while others think a “B” will be acceptable?__ 
   * I feel that we are all capable of getting an A if we work together as a team so this shouldn't be a problem.
1. __Is it acceptable for some team members to do more work on the assignment in order to get an “A”?__ 
   * In a perfect world, we should all be putting in about the same amount of effort.
1. __How much time per week do you anticipate it will take to make the project successful?__ 
   * At this point I'm not entirely sure, but I anticipate we will each need to put in at least 6-8 hours a week between our time working together and alone.
1. __How will you decide who should do what on the project and activities?__ 
   * We can divide everything up equally and discuss who is better fit for each part of the project/activities.
1. __What will happen if someone doesn’t follow through on a commitment (missing deadline, no show, etc.)?__ 
   * Im sure the whole team will be dissapointed, and I would expect that they finished their part asap so we can move on.
1. __What happens if people have different opinions on the quality of the work?__ 
   * We can discuss what we all agree is proficient, and make sure everyone adheres to that.
1. __How will you deal with different work habits of team members?__ 
   * I will do my best to adapt, just like a chameleon.
1. __Do you want to have a standing meeting time outside of class?__ 
   * I think it could be beneficial to set up a day and time that we know we can all meet for at least a little just to make sure everyone is on track.
1. __How often do you think the team will need to meet outside of class?__ 
   * At this point I think we will need to meet twice a week, but it could be more or less depending on the assignments.
1. __Will you need approval of every team member before making a decision?__ 
   * It would be best to get everyones approval, but if someone isn't reponding within a reasonable time frame, they might be left out on that decision.
1. __What will you do if every team member except one agrees on something?__ 
   * Listen to their reasoning and see if they can change everyones mind, but typically majority rules.
1. __What will you do if one person seems to be dominating the team process?__ 
   * If they are leading the team in a positive direction and everyone is happy about it I wouldn't mind, but if it became a problem it most likely could be solved by talking about it.
1. __What will you do if you feel most of the facilitation responsibilities are falling on you?__ 
   * I would try my best to get everyone to help out.
