### Team Preference 

Our goals as a group for the semester is to create a project that we are proud of. Also that we learn to work and communicate well 
with eachother. We plan on using slack for our primary means of communication. We anticipate that, for each person, it will take us 2-5 hours (depending on how much is due) per week to do a good job. We will have a weekly meetings 3 times a week, on the day of the class. By default the meeting time will be 3:30PM. During this weekly meeting, we will figure out what we should do, help each other with understand the task, and report new changes. We will discuss our preferences for the work and assign tasks accordingly. We may meet more times per week than just this one time, depending on workload.

Decisions will be made based on a majority vote, with each side being allowed to try and convince everyone else of their case beforehand. This is our team preferences. Hope we have great semester!
