/* Add your own styles here. Use of this file should be minimized at all costs. However, if you feel the need to
    declare your own CSS classes for a small padding fix or whatnot, this is the purpose of this file. You may be
    tempted to go all out with the styling of your website. We encourage you not to spend the time styling the pages
    for this class, and to spend that time on styling of your own personal webpage or side project.
